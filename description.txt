The Depths (Alternate Hell)
=========================================
0.2.0 Version
22/02/2022 Update ;)

Hello and welcome to the second mod we are working on to replace a vannilla biome in terraria. This time we are replacing the Underworld with the depths.
The Depths is focused around Gems and murcury and was a concept done y snickerbobble in 2015. Currently this mod is in early public release so many features may be missing or there may be a few bugs.

We encourage people make new worlds as this mod adds world generation to new worlds that allows the new content to be accessed.
